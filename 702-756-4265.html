 FREE REVERSE PHONE NUMBER LOOKUP database built by YOU, its users. Our strength is in our numbers - by sharing pieces of information each of us has we are putting together a free and public phone number directory with information no other service can provide.

Our phone rings quite often with scam callers. I look up the numbers here on this website and if they are a scam, I save the number as a scam # and set it to NO RING. But quite often we get a call where the caller ID says UNKNOWN NAME UNKNOWN CALLER. Because there is no number associated with this, I am unable to program it into my phone as a NO RING.

We do not answer questionable calls, does anyone have experience answering these calls, and can you tell me who might be on the other end of the line? I must assume they are phishers and <script>

With certain Uniden phones, you can program "Call Block" for numbers coming in with Unknown, and other parameters.

Answering the phone when Caller ID is munged or bastardized is foolish. As an alternative, pickup and immediately hang up.

It's not likely they're reputable people calling, and if they are, they need to get a clue.

This morning our phone rang at 6:15 am. Our bedroom phone has the ringer turned off, but my husband heard the phone ringing in the kitchen. He woke me up by asking who was calling us at this hour? He hurriedly picked up the phone and immediately hung up before the answering machine could pick up. The Caller ID listed the number as UNKNOWN NAME UNKNOWN NUMBER. 

We often get calls that read as such on the ID, but never before have they called at such an early hour.

Has anyone ever answered a call from these people? What is their scam?
